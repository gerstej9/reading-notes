# Class 14 Notes

## How to Build a Perfect Team; Google Research
* The bulk of modern work is team-based
* Groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems, achieve better results and have higher job satisfaction
* Profitability for corporations increases when workers collaborate more
* The most productive employees rotate dining companions at meals
* Most productive managers coomunicate and avoid micromanaging
* Project Aristotle was the name of the study Google conducted in 2012 on teamwork
* Group norms can have profound effects on teams
* Understanding and influencing group norms are key to improving team performance
* How teamates treat one another seperates good groups from bad ones
* One of two important behaviors good teams tend to have are equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking, everyone speaks an equal amount in the team
* The other is having high "average social sensititvy" or in other words were able to intuit how others felt based on tone of voice and body language
* These norms provide psychological safety, meaning the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking, characterized by trust and mutual respect
* Psychological safety and emotional conversations can be related, conversational turn taking and empathy are part of the same unwritten rules that help establish a bond

## CSS Transforms
* ```transform``` property comes in two and three dimensions
* Browser supports for transform can be shaky
* 2d transfomrs work on x and y axes
* ```rotate``` is one aspect of transform on 360 degree rotation
* ```scale``` affects size, default is 1 so <1 is smaller and >1 enlarges. You can scaleX or scaleY individually
* ```translate``` will move the object
* ```skew``` will stretch the object
* Can create a 2d cube by combining different types of transform
* transform ```origin``` switches where the point of the transform starts, it defaults to center
* ```perspective``` can be applied to a single element or parent element. Sets a vanishing point. Higher values sets depth greater
* Perspective origin acts similar to transform origin
* 3D transform properties are all similar but there are added features such as backface visibility and transform style

## Transitions and Animations
* Four transition properties
    * transition-property
    * transition-duration
    * transition-timing-function
    * transition-delay
* transition property determines what properties will be altered
* color and font sizes are among some of the properties that can use transitions
* transition duration can be in seconds of ms
* transition timing function is the speed of the transitition, values are linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out, step-start, step-stop and steps
* transitions can be delineated in shorthand as well
* For animations you can set a @keyframes rule to include name, breakpoints, and properties
* Animation name must be included to the element for which it is applied
* animation duration, timing, and delay are other properties
* Iteration is how many times it will run
* direction can be set
* Play state allows for pausing and resuming
* Animations can be written in shorthand as well

## 8 Simple but Effective Transitions
* Fade
* Color Change
* Grow and Shrink
* Rotate
* Square to Circle
* 3D Shadows
* Swing
* Inset Border
