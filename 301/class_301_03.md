## Javascipt Templating and Mustach.js
* Javascript templating is a technique to render client-side view templates with JS using a JSON data source
* The template is html markup that will either insert variables or run programming logic
* The engine than replaces the values with actual values at runtime and converts the template into an html file sent to the client
* Mustache is a logic-less template syntax that can be used for anything.
* It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided
* There are no if, else statements or for loops only tags
* mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in javascript. 
* ```Mustache.render("hello, {{name}}", { name:Sherlynn"}}``` is an example
* Mustaache-express allows for use of Node, Express and Mustache together


## CSS Tricks: Complete Guide to Flexbox
* Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts
* Parent element (flex container) and child elements (flex items")
* Parent container has display: flex
* Flex direction can be set on parent
* Flex order and grow can be added to child elements
* flex-wrap will prevent all items from squeezing onto one row
* Flex-shrink allows an item to shrink
* flew-flow is a shorthand for flex-direction and flew-wrap properties
* flex-basis defines the default size of an element  before the remaining space is distributed
* justify-content allows for the alignment of content on the main axis
* flex is shorthand for flex-grow, shrink, or basis combined
* align-self allows the default alignment to be overriden for an individual flex item
* align items defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis, equivalent to justify content in respect to the main axis
* align content aligns a flex container's lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis
