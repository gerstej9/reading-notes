## Introduction to Node.js, Sitepoint article by James Hibbard
* https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/
* Node.js is a JavaScript engine that uses Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
* Node is an enhanced version of V8 that can be executed outside of the browser, "JavaScript runtinme" as the article says
* The author suggests instead of using Node binaries for your system to rather download a version manager and switch between Node versions as needed
* Node.js offers support for ES6 and does not have many compatibility issues.
* npm is a package manager that is bundled with Node and we can use npm to install new packages using ```npm install```
* npm can install packages locally or globably
* node_modules is where npm saves the local project and any libraries it depends on.
* package.json will list the project under the dependencies field
* Build tools can be installed and ran using npm and Node respectively
* Certain frameworks like React and Angular require a working knowledge of Node and npm because these frameworks are available through npm and may rely on Node for environments
* Node.js is one of the first packages to let one run JS on the server
* Node.js is single threaded and event-driven in its execution so everything is a reaction to an event.
* This execution model prevents overhead and therefore can handle lots of connections.
* Node does have some downsides because of it's single-thread and asynchronous qualities
* Node is suited to applications that require real-time interaction or collaboration including chat sites or where work is shared.
* Node advantages include speed and scalability and allows for many tasks being done in one language. It also speaks JSON
* Node can also be used as a scripting language on your computer and as a command line tool
