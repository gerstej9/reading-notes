* Roy Fielding helped write the original web servers and helped to explain why the web works
* HTTP is the foundation of the web
* REST is the architectural style that the web is built upon
* REST defines a "resource" that HTTP points to, a URL informs the browser of a representation of a resource and the browser asks the web page for a representation of that concept
* APIs can be thought of in terms of a machine using the web in the way a human would
* Sending a browser from one information source to another in a search for the right data is called a redirect
* URLs have a great importance because they provide a standardized language even though most web pages can be written in different languages
* Polymorphism in programming refers to applying "Verbs" to different "nouns" i.e. being able to use a function like get on multiple items
