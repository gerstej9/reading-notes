* A pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments and does not cause any side effects
* Part of this includes never using a global object that is not passed into the function as a parameter
* Reading files and random number generators are not pure functions
* Side effects of non pure functions include omdifying global objects or a parameter that is passed in
* "Mutability is discouraged in functional programming"
* Instead of changing the value of a global variable in a function pass the variable into a function as a parameter, change that parameter value and return the value
* "Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable"
* Immutable data means it cannot be changed after its creation
* Recursion can be used to keep variables immutable
* Function chaining can be used as well to prevent changing variables
* "If a function consistenly yields the same result for the same input it is referentially transparent"
* "pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency"
* Treating functions as first class entities allows reference ot it form constants and variables, to pass it as a parameter to other functions and return it as a result from other functions
* Higher order functions take one or more functions as arguments or return a function as a result
* "The idea of reduce is to receive a function and a collection and return a value created by combining the items"

## "Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability (with Examples!)" by Andrew Healy

* A hash function such as Maps and Sets allow us to not have to iterate through an entire array to find a target
* Inline code, template literals, and seperating logic can help in refactoring code
* Some strategies that help for easy to read code are return early from functions, cache variables, check for web apis for functionality
