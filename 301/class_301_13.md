# Code 301 Class 13 Reading Notes

## Sending Form Data by MDN Web Docs
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data
* In client/server architecture HTTP protocol is used for requests and responses
* Form html elements determine how data will be sent
* Form attributes such as action and method help to determine this
* Action defines where data is sent and must be a url
* Methodd attribute is one of the several ways provided by HTTP protocol to perform a request such as GET and POST
* GET returns an empty body but the information will be added to the url
* ? followed by name=value pairs each one seperated by an &
* POST method takes into account the data provided in the request and can be found in request.body
* In browser tools you can view HTTP requests by selecting 'network', 'all, and the website url followed by 'headers'
* PHP is one method of retrieving data on the server side
* Python can also be used with Flask frameworkas can Express with Node.js
* Sending files with a form is a special case to do so you must take extra steps
  * set method to POST
  * set the value of `enctype = multipart/form-data`
  * include `<input type='file'`>
* HTML forms can be a security issue and therefore security issues must be considered when using forms
* A couple ways to do this are to:
  * Escape characters that looks like they may be JavaScript or SQL code
  * Limit amount of incoming data
  * Store uploaded files on a different server and allow access through a different subdomain or domain
  * In summation securing applications can be tough but that is not the primary role of the front-end developer and primarily rests with the server side development.
