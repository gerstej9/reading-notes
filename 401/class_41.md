# Code 401 Class 41 Reading Notes

## Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux "Ducks
* Redux "Ducks" is a modular pattern for utilizing Redux that has certain expectations such as that modules must export a default function called a reducer. That actions are types in the form of upper snake case. Redux Toolkit on the other hand has lots of built in aspects that mean you essentially just follow the template given to you for how to use Redux.
* In other words "Ducks" is a way of utilizing Redux that allows for a pattern to use while Redux Toolkit does the same but it has different rules to follow and is somehwat more opinionated in that you have to follow it's standards because they are built in.

## Define the Following Terms
