## HTML Chapter 5: Images

### Choosing and Storing Images
* Images should be relevant, convey information and mood, be recognizable and fit the color pallete
* Stock images are available online through third party platforms
* Images are usually stored in a folder called images but may sit an a folder more related to their usage such as product photos in products folder

### Adding Images
* ```<img src = "URL" alt = "alternative description title = "shows up on hover function and is optional to include"/>```
* Height and width can be set within the image tag ```<img ... height ="499" width = "200"/>```
* Placement of images
    * Before a paragraph makes the paragraph start on a new line after the image
    * Inside the start of a paragraph the first row of the text aligns with the bottom of the image
    * Middle of a paragraph results in the image between the words of the paragraph it appears in
    * If img is followed by a block level then the block element will sit on a new line after the image such as h1 and p
    * Inline elements sit within a block level element and do not start ona a new line such as b, em and img
* Old code ```align```left or right allows text to flow on either side of image
* Old code ```align``` top, middle, or bottom aligns the first line of text with the top middle or bottom of the image

### Creating Images, Types, Properties
* Three rules when creating images, save images in right format, save images at right size, and measure images in pixels
* Some tools to edit images and ensure their size include Adobe Photoshop and other software as well as online editors
* Image formats
    * .JPEG is beneficial for photos with many different colors/shades
    * .GIF or PNG for saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color
* Image dimensions can be changed to create a smaller, larger, or image with different dimensions
* When cropping images try to not add extra space, remove important information, or make potrait a landscape and vice-versa
* Image resolution is important to keep in mind for images on the web
* Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution independent, they are commonly created in programs like Adobe Illustrator
* Animated Gifs show several frames of an image in a sequence to create simple animations
* Images that are partially transparent involves using .gif or .png formats.
* You can examine the size of images online using a browser
* You can add cpations to images with the ```<figure>``` and ```<figcaption>``` tags

## HTML Chapter 11: Color

### Using Color in your Webpages
* Three common ways to specify colors plus others in CSS3
* Color terminology is important
* Contrast and making text readable
* Background color for entire webpage or parts of a page

### Foreground Color
* Color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element
* RGB values express color in terms of red, green and blue
    * `rgb(100,100,90)`
* Hex codes are six digit codes that represent amount of red, green, and blue in a color and are preceded by a hash sign
    * `#ee3e80`
* Color names specify 147 predefined color names
    *`DarkCyan`

### Background Color
* Background color for each HTML element "box"
* Specified in the same way as foreground color
* By default most browsers have a white background

### Understanding Color
* Every color on a computer screen is generated by mixing blue, red, and green.
* You can use a color picker to determine which color to use
* RGB values are numnbers between 0-255
* Hex codes has a hash followed by six characters
* Hue is a colloquial idea of color
* Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color
* Brightness refers to how much black is in a color

### Contrast
* Ensure there is good contrast between foreground and background so that text is legible
* Lack of contrast is particularly difficult for those with visual impairments and color blindness
* It also effects users with poor monitors of when sunlight is present
* High contrast makes reading easier, however, for large amounts of text medium contrast is better

### CSS3 Opacity, HSL and HSLA
* Opacity is introduced in CSS3 and allows for specifying the opacity of an element with a number between 0.0 and 1.0 i.e. .5 = 50% opacity
* A fourth value is required for RGBA values and that is for opacity
* Some browsers do not supoort this new RGBA format so it is important to have a fallback solid color
* HSL colors stands for hue, saturation and lightness values
    * HSL colors show hue as a color circle or slider
    * Saturation and lightness as percentage values
    * `background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 78%);`
* HSLA adds the opacity value "alpha"
    * `background-color: hsla(0, 0%, 78%, 0.5)`

## HTML Chapter 12: Text

### Typeface

### Font Dependent
* Terminology
    * Serif means flourishes
    * Sans-serif is without flourishes
    * Monospace means equal width between characters
    * Weight is the thickness of the characters
    * Style is normal, italic or oblique
    * Stretch makes characters thinner and closer or wider and farther
* Choosing a typeface
    * Serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, fantasy
    * It is common to add the generic font name after your preferred choice in case a browser does not support your choice
    * ```font-family: Georgia, Times, serif;```
* Wider choices of typeface
    * Font-family standard and no license needed but limited
    * Font-face can be downloaded in a file, license must allow use, choice limited to whichever are free licensing
    * Service based font-face ongoing fee but more options
    * Images can contain the text as wanted
    * SLFR font is embedded in Flash movie
    * Cufon similar to sLFR uses javascript to create a SVG version
* Specifying typeface
    ```font-family```
* Size of type
    * ```font-size```
    * Type scales
    * Units of type size include pixels, percentages, and em
* Font face requires @font-face with font-family, src and format specified
* Different browsers understand different font formats so you need to supply multiple for the different browsers
* ```font-weight``` for bold
* ```font-style``` for italic

### Font Independent
* Uppercase and Lowercase ```text-transform```
* Underline and strikethrough ```text-decoration```
* Leading ```line-height```
* Letter and word spacing ```letter-spacing``` and ```word-spacing```
* Alignment ```text-align```
* Vertical alignment ```vertical-align```
* Indentation ```text-indent```
* CSS3 Drop Shadow ```text-shadow```
* First letter or line ```p.intro:first-letter{}```
* Styling links link or visited ```p.intro:link{}```
* Responding to users hover, active, and focus
    * ```hover``` when a cursor is over the item
    * ```active``` when an element is being activated
    * ```focus``` when the user is ready to interact with an item such as a text box
* Attribute selectors
    * ```p[class]``` [] matches a specific attribute
    * ```p[class = "dog"]``` matches a specific attribute with a specific value
    * ```p[class~-= "dog"]``` matches specific attribute whose value appears in a space seperated by a list of words
    * ```p[attr^"d"]``` matches a specific attribute whose value begins with a specific string
    * ```p[attr*"do"]``` targets any p element with an attribute whose value contains letters do
    * ```p[attr$"g"]``` suffix targets any p element with attribute whose value ends with the letter g
