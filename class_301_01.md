## Shay Howe Responsive Web Design
* Responsive web design is a result of increased mobile device usage

### Responsive Overview
* RWD is the practice of building a website that will work on every screen regardless of size
* Term is coined by Ethan Marcotte
* Responsive web design means to react quickly and positively to change while adaptive web design means to be easily modified for new purpose or situation
* Mobile means to build a seperate website on a new domain strictly for mobile users but normally isn't a great idea
* Responsive web design can be broken into three divisions; flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media

### Flexible Layouts
* Flexible layouts are the practice of building the layout ofa website with a flexible grid capable of resizing to any width
* This is done using relative lengths through percentages or units
* CSS3 introduced new relative length units such as 
    * vw viewports width
    * vmin minimum of the viewports height and width
    * wh viewports height
    * vmax maximum of the viewports height
* target + context = result is the formula used

### Media Queries
* Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles
* They provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances
* @media rule inside an existing style sheet is most common way of implementing this
* Media queries may include a media type followed by one or more expressions, types include all, screen, print, tv, and braille
* When type and values are true styles are applied vs if they are false
* Logical operators help to power these, there are three types ```and, not, only```
* Media features identify what attributes or properties will be targeted within the media query expression
* Some common media features revolve around determining height or width for a device or browser viewport
* Orientation: landscape or potrait
* Aspect ratio
* Resolution

### Mobile First
* One popular technique with media queries is called mobile first which is an approach that includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles
* This allows for lower bandwiddth for mobile devices and adds on as needed for larger devices
* This will also allow for lesser input and adding on more as needed

### Viewport
* Apple created a viewport meta tag
* viewpoint meta tag with height or width values will define the viewport dimensions, each value excepts positive interger or keyword such as device-height
* To control viewport scale utilize, minimum-scale, maximum-scale, initial-scale, and user-scalable properties
* For viewport resolution utilize target-densitydpi property with values of device-dpi, high-dpi, mdium-dpi, low-dpi or a dpi number


### Flexible Media
* Making media scalable isn't always easy but can be done by making max-width: 100%
* This won't work for iframe embedded content, to make it fully responsive it needs to be absolutely positioned within a parent element
* 


## CSS Tricks: All About Floats by Chris Coyier
* A float is a CSS positioning property, it allows text to wrap around certain containers such as an image
* Floats can be used to create entire web layouts
* Floats can affect their parent element, if the parent element contains nothing but floated elements the height will collapse to nothing
* This can be fixed by clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container
* Empty div method is one wy to do this
* Overflow method relies on setting the overflow property on a parent element
* Easy clearing method uses pseudo selector :after to clear floats
* Different scenarios will call for different float clearing methods
* Problems with floats are that they can be fragile
* Pushdown is a symptom of an element inside a floated item being wider than the float itself. Quick fix is to use overflow hidden
* Double Margin Bug
* 3px Jog
* Bottom Margin Bug are other bugs to look out for
* For page layouts alternative to floats are faux abosolute positioning and template layout module in CSS3
