## Ducket: Javascript and JQuery Chapter 7: JQuery
* JQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common javascript tasks quickly and consistently including selecting elements, performing tasks, and handling events
* JQuery is a JS file that you include in web pages that allows you to find elements using CSS-style selectors and then do something using jquery methods
* ```$('li.hot')addClass('complete')```
* Similarities to DOM
    * Perform similar tasks with simple syntax
    * Can store JQuery object in a variable
    * Can use Jquery methods and properties to manipulate DOM
* Differences
    * Cross-browser without need for fallback code
    * Selecting elements and event handling are simpler
    * Methods affect all the selected elements without needing to loop through
    * Additional methods are provided for tasks such as animation
    * Once you have made a selection you can apply multiple methods to it
* You must include jQuery script in your page before closing body tag
* Second JS file added that uses jQuery
* Can find versions of jQuery at jQuery.org and can find minified versions as well which have unecessary items stripped from the code
* JQuery should be used because it allows for simple selectors, common tasks in less code, and cross-browser compatibility

### Selection and Methods
* If a selector returns one element the jquery object contains reference to just one element node
* If a selector returns multiple elements the object contains references to each element
* If a query selection holds more than one element and a method is used to get information from it it will retrieve information from only the first element.
* If a query selection holds more than one element and a method is used to update information on the page it will update all of the elements in a matched set not just the first one
* When you create a selection with jquery it stores a reference to the corresponding nodes in the DOM tree it does not create copies of them
* A Jquery object stores references to elements, cachinga jquery object stores a reference to it in a variable

### Looping and Chaining
* You can update multiple elements using one method with jquery without using a loop, this is known as implicit iteration
* You can list multiple methods at a time on one selection and this is known as chaining
* Methods that can be used to update a selection can be chained, however, most methods that retrieve information from the DOM or about the browser cannot be chained

### jQuery Methods
* .ready() method checks that the page is ready for your code to work with
* ```$(document).ready(function(){script here});```
* Shorthand is ```$(function({}));```
* .html and .text allow for retrieving information from a selector
* ```var $listHTML = $('ul').html()```
* .html and .text can also be used to update the content of a selector
* .replaceWith() replaces every element in a matched set with new content and returns the replaced elements
* .remove() removes all of the elements in a matched set
* .before() and .after() insert content before and after html tags
* .prepend() and .append() insert content inside the opening tag or before the closing tag
* .attr and .removeAttr() can get or set an attribute and remove one respectively
* addClass() and removeClass() can do the same with classes
* .css can be used to get a CSS property and to set a value or property
* .each() allows you to perform one or more statements on each of the items in the selection of elements
* this or $(this) allos you to access the current element as you utilize .each to iterate through

### Event handling
* .on() method is used to handle all events such as 
    * UI: focus, blur, change
    * Keyboard: input, keydown, keyup, keypress
    * Mouse: click, dblclick, mouseup, mousedown, mouseover, mousemove, mouseout, hover
    * Form: submit, select, change
    * Document: ready, load, unload
    * Browser, error, resize, scroll
* Every handling function receives an event object that has properties
    * Tyoe
    * Which
    * Data
    * Target
    * PageX
    * PageY
    * TimeStamp
    * .preventDefault()
    * stopPropagation
* Additional parameters can be added ```.on(events[ , selector][, data], function(e));```
### Ways to include jQuery in your page
* You can utilize CDN in addition to hosting the jQuery file with the rest of your website
* Positioning of scripts for jQuery can affect how quickly the page loads
* script tags in the head can make pages seem slower to load
* Placing script tag at end of body allows for page rendering first uninterrupted by javascript or jquery

## Pair Programming
* Pair programming is the concept of two coders sharing one workstation
* Consists of the driver who is typing and the navigator who uses words to guide
* Pair programming touches on explaining what code does, listening to guidance, reading others code and writing code
* Pair programming has the following six benefits
    1. Greater efficiency
    1. Engaged collaboration
    1. Learning from fellow students
    1. Social skills
    1. Job interview readiness
    1. Work environment readiness
