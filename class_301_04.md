* Regex stands for regular expressions and are beneficial for extracting information from any text
* It is a tool that can be used in most code languages
* The following tools are used for matching
* Anchors are ^ and $
* Quantifiers are * + ? and {}
* ```OR operator | or []```
* Character classes \d \w \s and .
* Common regex form is /abc/
* g (global) does not return after first match
* m (multi-line) makes anchors match the start and end of a line instead of whole string
* i (insensitive) makes expression case-insensitive
* Grouping is useful for extracting information with multiple occurrences
* "Quantifiers 8 and {} are greedy operators so they expand the match as far as possible"
* \babc\b are boundaries to find a pattern that is fully surrounded by word characters
* \1 are back references
* According to the article regex can be used for 
    * data validation
    * data scraping
    * data wrangling
    * string parsing
    * string replacement
    * syntax highlighting

## Common Responsive Layouts with CSS Grid (and some without!) by Jo Franchetti

* CSS grid allows for elements in multiple rows and columns
* "Grid gives us control over how wide or narrow each of the 'grid cells' get"
* ```grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));```
* Repeat function takes two arguments
    * number of columns
    * width of columns
* minmax takes two values
* fr stands for fraction unit for a fraction of available space
* ```object-fit: cover``` can help images from stretching out of proportion
* The grid gap property defines space between the columns and rows
* span value on grid-column and grid-row can be used to make cells stretch over two or more columns/rows
* ```break-inside:avoid``` can be used to stop images from being split across multiple columns

## CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Grid
* https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
* Parent container properties are as follows;
* display : grid or inline-grid
* grid-template-columns or rows: values are track size and line name
* grid-template-area: grid area, . signifies empty cell, and none is none defined
* grid-template is a shorthand for combining grid-template-rows, -columns, and -areas
* gap: length of row and column gaps
* justify items: start, end, center, stretch
* align items: start, end, center, stretch
* place-items: shorthand for align items and justify items
* justify-content: start, end, center, stretch, space-around, space-between, space-evenly
* align-content: start, end, center, stretch, space-around, space-between, space-evenly
* grid-auto-columns and -rows: track size
* grid-auto-flow: row, column, dense
* grid: allows for shorthand of multiple aspects
* Children grid item properties
* "float, display: inline-block or table-cell, vertical align and column-* properties have no effect on a grid item"
* grid-column-start and -end and -row-start/end determine grid item's location, values: line, span, span, auto
* grid-column and grid-row are shorthand
* grid-area: name and row start/column start/row end/column end
* justify-self: start, end, center, stretch
* align-self: start, end, center, stretch
* place-self: auto, align-self/justify-self
