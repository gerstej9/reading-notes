* https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs
* In getting started Heroku the CLI requires Git
* Run this code to download heroku ```brew install heroku/brew/heroku```
* Next you can run heroku by first logging in ```heroku login``` which then will take you to the website to confirm your login
* You then will want the NodeJS-getting-started git repo found on Github and sourced through the Heroku CLI instructions
* To create an app you deploy heroku using ```heroku create```
* You will then load your code with ```git push heroku main```
* Followed by ensuring at least one instance of your app is running with ```heroku ps:scale web =1```
* And then you will be able to open the app with ```heroku open```
* At this point you can view the aciivity logs of your running app by utilizing ```heroku logs --tail```
* These notes are a summary of my understanding of the instructions provided by Heroku CLI documentation
