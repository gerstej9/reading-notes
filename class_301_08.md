* SQL stands for Structured Query Language, it allows users to query, manipulate and transform data from a "relational" database
* SQL provides safe and scalable storage
* Multiple SQL databases exist include SQLite, mySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL server
* A relational database is a collection of related tables similar to spreadsheets with fixed columns and any number of rows
* SQL allows us to "answer questions" about data
* Queries in SQL are written with SELECT statements
* ```SELECT column, another_column, FROM mytable```
* ```*``` is for retrieving all information from a table
* ```WHERE condition``` clause allows for filtering of a query based on conditions
* Certain operators for WHERE statements include column_name followed by;
  * =, !=, <, >, >=, <=
  * BETWEEN...AND...
  * NOT BETWEEN...AND...
  * IN(..)
  * NOT IN(...)
* By constraining information returning from a query using conditions the program will run faster
* Text data can be examined through SQL with its own set of operators, strings must be quoted in query
* SELECT DISTINCT allows for removal of duplicate rows
* ORDER BY colum ASC/DESC for ordering
* LIMIT specifies number of rows returned and OFFSET decides where returned rows begin
* Queries can be done across multiple tables using a INNER JOIN clause if the tables have a primary key
* OUTER JOIN can also be used when tables do not have symmetrical data
* INSERT INTO statements allow for row insertion
* CREATE TABLE for table creation
* DELETE for deletion
* ALTER TABLE for changing values or renaming columns
* DROP TABLE for deleting a table and its schema
