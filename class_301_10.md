# Code 301 Class 10 Reading Notes

## Call Stack from MDN Web Docks
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack
* "A call stack allows an interpreter to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions"
* A call stack is essentially a waiting list at a restaurant, if a function calls another function I think of it like a party of 2, yourself and the friend you brought are on the waitlist
* If too many people are on the waitlist so to speak a "stack overflow" will occur

## The JavaScript Call Stack - What It Is and Why It's Necessary by Charles Freeborn
* https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/
* A JavaScript engine is "a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack"
* Call stacks are mainly used for function execution, performed one at a time in a synchronous fashion
* LIFO is Last in First out principle used by call stack data structure
* "last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns" after stack overflow error
* The stack frame is a memory location in the call stack and is cleared when a function pops out of the stack
* Stack overflows occur when a function calls itself without and exit point

## JavaScript error messages && debugging by Diogo Spinola
* https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c
* Reference errors are when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared
* Syntax errors occur when something cannot be parsed in terms of syntax
* Range errors refer to manipulating an object with length and providffing a number out of range
* Type errors show up when trying to use or access the wrong type of data
* To debug one of the easiest ways is using the console log
* You can also use breakpoints and walk through your code
* Try and catch errors can be used to fallback to a default application state in case of an error
* These allow your application to continue running even if some side effects occur
* Tools such as quokka and eslint can help you code while you type so that you do not have to wait until running the code to see that you have made a mistake
