## Database Normalisation (Explained in Simple English) by Kris Wenzel and hosted on EssentialSQL
* https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-database-normalization-explained-in-simple-english/
* Database normalization is used to organize a database into tables and columns
* Limiting the purpose of a table reduces duplicate data in a database
* Database normalization is predominantly to minimize duplicate data, avoid issues with modifying data and to make queries less complex
* Three normal forms databases adhere to using because they prevent anomalies
* Duplicate data increases storage and decreases performance as well as making data changes difficult to maintain
* It can be hard to insert data for a table that has multiple purposes because you might not know the value for every column
* Updating a complex table can be difficult if something changes and you need to change multiple values
* Deleting one row to get rid of a certain value in one column can cause the loss of the values in other columns
* The three forms of normalization are 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, and written as 1NF, 2NF, 3NF
* These forms are progressive so you need to travel from 1st to 3rd in the process
* 1st: information is stored in a table with no repeating groups of columns
* 2nd: All columns depend on the table's primary key
* 3rd: All table columns are not "transitively dependent on the primary key"
